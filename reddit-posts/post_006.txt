INTRODUCTION TO $FUSD



$FUSD is an appreciating stabletoken. It is designed to maintain a stable value while increasing in net worth over time, using an upward price mechanism to push the price higher, consistently.



Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies known for their volatility, an appreciating stabletoken provides investors with a reliable store of value that also offers a long-term capital appreciation. This unique combination makes $FUSD an attractive asset for preserving wealth as a stable token and provides the holders an continual increase in value for their investment.



HOW DOES IT WORK?



In simple terms, a stable coin doesn't have a set supply, but instead uses the contract to mint a new token each and every time one is purchased and equally burns a token each time one is sold.

By using this mechanism they can ensure that every token available to be bought or sold will always have a 1:1 value of $1.





MEET $FUST - THE GATEWAY TO MINING THE FUTURE OF STABLE ASSETS



An important early build within the FUSD ecosystem was the introduction of Fusion token (FUST) which provides an opportunity for its holders to mine free FUSD.



FUST has tokenomics which mirror those of a typical cryptocurrency, and allows those Degens who buy into the FUSD philosophy - but who also enjoy the thrill of chasing fast green candles - to make their play within the structure of the FUSD ecosystem and benefit from the best of both worlds; the possibility of a fast ride upwards whilst earning a passive income paid in the appreciating stable token courtesy of their FUST bag.



By placing FUST tokens in the Fusion Miner, a steady supply of FUSD is bought from the FUSD chart by a bot funded by the arbitrage of multiple cryptocurrencies against FUST. This FUSD is then distributed amongst all the miners.



Tokens locked inside the Fusion Miner can be released before the locked period ends for a 5% early release fee.





MINE STABILITY, EARN FREEDOM



$FUST isn’t just a token — it’s the key to generating $FUSD, a revolutionary appreciating stablecoin backed 1:1 by USDC. Through its innovative mining protocol, holders and stakers of $FUST can mine $FUSD passively, gaining access to an ever-growing supply of value with zero additional cost.



ELITE LINEAGE, PROVEN VISION



Brought to you by the founders of The Crypto Magazine, Liquid NFTs, and the powerhouse behind The Crypto Marketing Company, $FUST comes with a pedigree few projects can match. This is not a meme — this is infrastructure.



CEX-READY & REGULATORY FORWARD 



$FUST and its ecosystem partner token already have a confirmed listing on a Tier 1, US-licensed centralized exchange, ensuring early access, deep liquidity, and serious visibility from day one.
