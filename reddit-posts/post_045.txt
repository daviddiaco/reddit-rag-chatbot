[LAUNCH] ZRXT Token Sale Now Live – Utility Token by 3D Printer Manufacturer Zortrax

Hi everyone  
We’re excited to announce that the token sale for **ZRXT** is now officially live. ZRXT is an ERC-20 utility token created by **Zortrax**, a European 3D printer manufacturer active since 2013. Our company has built and delivered professional-grade 3D printing hardware to clients across aerospace, automotive, medical and industrial sectors.

ZRXT is designed to be a real utility token connected to a functioning hardware ecosystem. While utility features like product discounts will be introduced post-sale, the infrastructure is already in place to support on-chain referrals from day one. Users can generate their own referral links without any registration or KYC, and earn token rewards as new users join the ecosystem.

What distinguishes ZRXT is its connection to a public company. Zortrax is listed as a joint-stock company in Poland and publishes quarterly financial statements. As part of our commitment to tokenholder alignment, **10% of the company’s operating profit** will be used each quarter to buy back ZRXT tokens from the open market. All tokens purchased this way will be permanently burned, creating long-term deflation and directly linking token flow to business results.

There is no VC round, no private presale and no airdrop. We’ve opted for a public-first model — the token sale is open now and accessible to anyone with an Ethereum-compatible wallet.

You can join the sale and find the whitepaper at: [https://token.zortrax.com](https://token.zortrax.com)

We welcome your feedback and support as we move into this next phase.
