🚨 New Meta? Solana Validator Raffles 30% of Rewards Weekly to LST Holders - Only 120 People in So Far

In the sea of copy-paste staking projects, this one actually caught my attention.
Vybe Network, a Solana validator + API provider with over 100K SOL staked, just launched something called Vybe Draw, a weekly raffle where they give away 30% of their validator rewards to anyone holding their LST, VybeSOL.

That’s a minimum of 20 SOL/week, split between 3 winners:
🔹1st: ~10 SOL (50%)
🔹2nd: ~6 SOL (30%)
🔹3rd: ~4 SOL (20%)

How to earn tickets:

🔸10 tickets/day per VybeSOL you hold
🔸5 tickets/day for every VybeSOL held by someone you referred

They’ve also added multipliers to reward engagement:

🔸Referral Boost: +25% on your final ticket count if you use a referral code
🔸Balance Multiplier: Bigger VybeSOL holdings can boost your tickets up to 2.5x


Raffle draws happen every Monday at 5PM PST.
How to Join:
1. Go to vybe.fyi/raffle
2. Connect your wallet
3. Click “Join Vybe Draw” and agree to ToS
4. You can swap SOL to VybeSOL directly on the site or on Sanctum.so/vybesol 

That’s it. You're in.

If you do sign up, using a referral code gives you a 25% ticket boost.
If you want to use mine, I’d really appreciate it 🙏

Pretty cool concept — I’ve never seen a validator do something like this before.

Good luck!
