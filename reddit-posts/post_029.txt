Under-the-Radar AI+DeFi Gem? $MANEKI Still Sitting at $2M MC With Full Product Live

It’s been over 20 days since $MANEKI launched.  
No big VC pump. No influencer wave. Still chilling around a \~$2M cap.  
And yet... the product is already **live** and **working** — while other projects are mooning on promises alone.

Here’s the real breakdown

**What Is $MANEKI?**

Maneki is an AI-powered DeFi assistant. Think: Zapper + ChatGPT + RWA yield aggregator — but usable.

Core features include:

* **AI Portfolio Breakdown:** Connect wallet, get instant risk analysis, asset heatmaps, and optimization tips.
* **Yield Strategy Engine:** Tracks 9 chains + 40+ protocols. Recommends vaults/farms based on your assets + risk profile.
* **1-Click Execution:** Swaps, bridges, LPing — all handled by Maneki. Zero headache.
* **Live Tracking + Alerts:** Real-time ROI, market alerts, rebalancing suggestions.

All **live right now**, not “coming in Q4.”

**Why Hasn’t It Exploded Yet?**

* Not meme-able (yet). No viral meta.
* AI model isn’t magic — it still needs savvy users.
* Points system exists, but needs stronger stickiness.
* Token unlock for the team in 10 days, which might be holding back buyers.
* Staking doesn’t currently yield more points (which weakens buy pressure).

**But Here’s the Thing…**

>

Once the **narrative** hits — AI meets DeFi meets automation — it could reprice fast.

If you're hunting low-cap, real-product projects **before** hype catches up…  
This is one of the better asymmetric bets out there.

**DYOR** — contract is on Base, token: `$MANEKI`.
