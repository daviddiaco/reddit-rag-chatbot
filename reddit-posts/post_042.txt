We all know about raiding competitions and the airdrops that come with them—like $SRY’s recent airdrop of 18K back then, which I think is now worth around 30K or something.



Anyway, that’s not what I wanted to talk about today. Today, I want to talk about trading competitions. Have you ever thought about something like this in the memecoin space? Personally, I never imagined it would be possible, but guess what?

$SRY is making it a reality! They will be releasing a platform where you can trade against others on a specific memecoin, and if you win, you not only keep your winnings but also receive an airdrop if you're the top trader. That’s amazing!

The best part? This won’t just be available for the Sorry token but also for other memecoins though the fees will go back into Sorry’s marketing and burns. Isn’t that great? Honestly, I can’t wait. I’m hyped as hell to participate in my first trading competition and win some prizes (though I’ll probably lose, haha).

I think this is one of the most unique utilities I’ve ever seen for a memecoin. It sounds extremely bullish for $SRY as well, so I bought some more—but as always, DYOR.



If you want to understand the upcoming platform, you can listen to the X Space where they explained everything in detail if you missed it:
