$HEGE: buys rolling in, up 40% in two days

$HEGE, the original story driven memecoin, is currently pumping hard. In the run up to the upcoming exchange listing on BiFinance (Thursday June 12^(th)), $HEGE’s market cap has grown by 40% in just two days.

Two days ago, $HEGE’s price bounced off its established floor of $0,006. The original story driven memecoin is currently trading at $0,0085. That is a massive 40% price increase. A look at $HEGE’s Telegram channel (check it out via hegecoin.com) reveals that buys are continuously rolling in.

$HEGE’s team has recently launched their phase 3.0 marketing push. This was made possible by a $400K community donated marketing fund. Previous marketing pushes led to 8x – 10x price rallies. Part of $HEGE’s marketing push is an upcoming merchandise store. Tier-1 exchange listings are also being explored.

The current pump could be the indicator that $HEGE’s current consolidation phase is coming to an end. It is hard to time that ending exactly: previous pumps happened in the blink of an eye. $HEGE was unexpectedly listed for free on as well on Guarda wallet. That is a clear sign of trust in and expected growth of this project. $HEGE was fairly launched and exchanges can therefore not be given a supply of coins to dump on investors, which is a practice less reliable coins have sought refuge in.

In the past months, $HEGE has positioned itself to profit from the expected Q3 and Q4 bull run. The project registered itself as an official company in the UK, which increases trust, credibility and opens the door to real-world partnerships. $HEGE is also about to launch a merchandise store, furthering its mission to become a multi-cycle brand coin. The project also continued to produce original artwork while establishing itself as one of the cultural pillars of the Solana-ecosystem and onboarded new artists with a well-publicized JupxDrip art competition.

These actions are supported by the fact that long-term holders have stayed during the market turmoil of the past weeks. Where other memecoins are used for quick&dirty profit taking, $HEGE’s top 250 holders have held on to their coins for over 200 days. This is a clear sign of confidence in large potential gains. Another bullish fact is that the current pump is caused by an inflow of new holders. You can check this for yourselves at holderscan.com. Holder inflow was the clear signal for previous price rallies.
