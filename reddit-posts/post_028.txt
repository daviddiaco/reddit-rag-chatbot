$Pyrate got a brand new game bot

Looking for an awesome crew to vibe with, maybe toss in a game of rock, paper, scissors while hunting for that next 100x? Say ahoy to $PYRATE. 🏴‍☠️

🕹️ Just launched a brand-new Telegram game bot — kicking things off with rock, paper, scissors. You can jump in with as little as 1 PYRATE, making it super easy to test the waters. Whether you’re in for the fun or the grind, it’s a unique twist most memecoins don’t offer. And trust us — this is just the beginning…

🧠 More mini-games are already in the works, dropping over the next few weeks. The devs are active and committed — they’re building while others are still tweeting.

💬 The community? Chill, funny, and welcoming. Like a digital pirate tavern where degens, gamers, and meme-lovers all raise a glass together.

⚓️ Why you should take a look:
• Market cap ≈ 300k – you’re still early
• Unique pirate branding with meme & viral potential
• Real utility right now via the Telegram gaming bot
• Website: https://pyrate.fun
• CA: 5odbSFH3kKHFNcy6Kai7ykm7Da9B55Kk9wgy4Fh8GSfh

Hop aboard or miss the boat. DYOR, but this gem might just sail far. 🌊
