$401jk the next spx6900 here to replace your 401k. CTO

Enter: $401 JK The meme token that doesn't just exist to be funny - it hurts because it's true.

401 (k) plans are a joke?

Economic collapse is the new aesthetic?

Millennials are broke, burnt out, and betting on memes?

This isn't just another degenerate bet - this is satire with teeth. The kind of coin that people ape into not just because it's funny - but because it feels real.

Instantly recognizable concept (everyone knows 401k, everyone hates it)

Built for virality: punchy, ironic, and painfully relatable

Memes that cut deep and have existential laughs

Murad's Meme Doctrine? This one follows it to the letter.

$401 JK is what happens when Twitter humor, economic despair, and meme culture have a baby and list it on-chain.

$401jk isn't just another pump - it's a future $1 billion ticker in disguise. Wake up. This is the dip. Legends aren't made selling early. They're made holding smart.
