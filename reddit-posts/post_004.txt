type shit is a phrase for internet history

**“Type Shit” isn’t just a token — it’s a phrase etched into internet history. We're making this one official meme token for it on Solana.**

**Type Shit**, most commonly, it’s used to express approval, co-sign something high quality, or as shorthand for “that kind of stuff.” Over time, it’s evolved into a cultural tag for raw authenticity, effortless flex, and not over-explaining.

Now, it’s on-chain.

There’s **no other token** out there with this name. It’s wild no one claimed it earlier — but that’s the beauty. We’re first. We’re real.

The **art goes hard** — not Canva-core, but visuals that carry the chaotic, late-night energy of tweet storms, unreleased tracks, and alpha-filled Discords. You don’t just see it — you feel it.

The **team is based**. No overpromising. No fluff. Just shipping, memeing, and vibing. They get it.

And most importantly — **this thing is full of chads**. Meme snipers. CT sickos. Alpha hunters who actually understand internet culture. This isn’t some pump & dump. It’s a living meme. A cultural artifact.

**This is $typeshit**  
**You already know what it is.**
