Political Compass Memes - $PCM

Political Compass Memes ($PCM) is a cryptocurrency project that satirizes political ideologies through the lens of the Political Compass, a two-axis model measuring economic policy (left–right) and social policy (authoritarian–libertarian). Inspired by the viral Political Compass Test—which asks users to respond to 62 propositions to plot their ideological coordinates—the coin leverages memes to caricature the four quadrants: Authoritarian Left (AuthLeft), Authoritarian Right (AuthRight), Libertarian Left (LibLeft), and Libertarian Right (LibRight). AuthLeft memes mock state-centric socialism and rigid hierarchies, often featuring stereotypes of tankies or bureaucratic overreach. AuthRight humor targets free-market fundamentalism blended with traditionalism, poking fun at corporatocracy and hyper-nationalism. LibLeft content champions social justice and anti-capitalist egalitarianism, lampooning "woke" excesses and utopian communes, while LibRight memes glorify anarcho-capitalism and deregulation, ridiculing crypto-bros and survivalist libertarianism. By mapping absurdist scenarios onto the compass—like debating whether a "state-mandated girlfriend" belongs in AuthLeft or AuthRight—the coin captures the internet’s obsession with ideological pigeonholing. Its design reflects the test’s core premise: politics isn’t a binary left-right spectrum but a dynamic interplay of economic and social values, where even the most extreme positions become fodder for communal laughter.
