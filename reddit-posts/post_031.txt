$NOMASK: The Real Beta for $MASK—Same Cat, No Mask

Forget masks. This cat doesn’t care, and neither should you.
Crypto community, pay attention.

$NOMASK isn’t messing around. It’s the real beta for $MASK—the exact same cat, but without the mask. It’s a direct challenge to conformity, inspired by Trump’s bold “NO MASKS” tweet about protesters that Elon retweeted.

	•	Clear Message: No mask means no compromises. It’s about freedom, speech, and standing firm.

	•	Trending Soon: This meme cat will take over X, TikTok, and Reddit fast—count on it.

	•	Murad’s Meme Rules: Organic growth, no gimmicks, and real meme energy guaranteed.

	•	Same Cat, Stronger Statement: Keeping $MASK’s spirit alive, but bolder and louder.

$NOMASK merges meme culture and blockchain—no apologies, no hesitations. It’s not just another crypto; it’s a statement about what you stand for.

This isn’t some quick flip—it’s a genuine contender. Smart money rides the dips and holds tight.
