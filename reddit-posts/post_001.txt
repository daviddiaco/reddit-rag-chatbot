It’s getting harder to earn in web3 space, but here’s something creators in the EU should check out

Getting paid in web3 is not as easy as it used to be. A lot of projects that used to reward content creators or offer bounties have either slowed down or disappeared completely. Unless you're working directly with a protocol or already deep in a DAO, it's tough to find good and consistent opportunities right now.

Some exchanges like still run creator initiatives, but most are invite-only or limited to selected ambassadors. Some had some campaigns earlier in the year, but they’re not open all the time or even mostly shifted to focusing on performance-based deals for larger creators.

But Btget recently launched something a little different and it's more open than most. They’re running a program called the Bitget Builders Creator Bounty Program, and it’s available specifically for creators from EU countries like Germany, Italy, and Poland.

The whole idea is to reward creators for making content about the exchange and the broader crypto space. You don’t need a big audience or fancy editing. You just need to create solid content that helps educate or inform.

You can post tutorials, market commentary with a focus on Btget-listed tokens, simple product walkthroughs like Spot or Futures, or just a thoughtful review of the platform’s features. Your content can be in video, text, carousel, animation, or any format you’re comfortable with.

Top 100 posts will get rewarded between 10 to 300 USDT. The top 50 creators will also be added to a private Telegram group for future paid opportunities. And the top 10 will get access to more exclusive perks and long-term deals.

Compared to a lot of creator bounties out there, this one is actually practical. It’s not just about follower count or who can go viral. It seems like they’re really looking for consistent, quality posts from creators who already know crypto and want to grow with a platform.

If you're from the EU and you’re already active online or you’re trying to get started  this could be something worth jumping on
