Holding $10K in Exchange Tokens: Who Came Out Ahead?

Just diving into that CryptoRank.io post on X about $10K in exchange tokens over two months...

Here’s how $10K in native tokens performed across 5 major exchanges over 2 months:

• Binance $BNB: +10%  
• Bitget $BGB: +7%  
• OKX $OKB: +6%  
• Bybit $MNT: -12%  
• Gate io $GT: -13%

$BNB, $BGB, and $OKB held up well showing steady price growth, with $BGB delivering the highest farming rewards in the group.

As a trader, I often check how staking and liquidity plays can juice up returns beyond just price.

Earlier this year, I jumped into Bitget’s LaunchX on Jan 20th with 2k BGB (cost me $13k). Scored 835.83 $J tokens, sold them at $1.00 listing for $835.83, then dumped the rest of my BGB at $7.157, raking in $13,884.58.

Total haul: $14,559.83. After subtracting my $13,724 capital and a $29 fee (0.1% taker), I netted $967.41.... about a 7% gain. Not life-changing, but solid for a quick move!

This kinda staking for tokens, leveraging cross-chain liquidity, feels like the defi sweet spot.

Anyone else stacking or chasing liquid staking?
