Solaxy: Solana’s First Layer-2 Solution—Scalability Achieved?

Have you ever experienced using Solana in a crypto craze and gotten slow transactions or failures? 



That’s the problem Solaxy is aiming to address as Solana’s first ever Layer-2 solution. 



Imagine Solana as a busy highway, and Solaxy is an express lane that clears the traffic from the major road, leaving the transactions faster with lower fees.



Solaxy uses rollup technology to roll up transactions off-chain and settle them back to Solana, thus reducing congestion and increasing scalability.



It has already collected over $33 million in pre-sales, which means that the investors are extremely confident. With staking rewards of up to 120% APY and plans for cross-chain bridges between Ethereum and Solana, Solaxy is positioning itself as one of the frontrunners in the blockchain scalability game.



Although there are many Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, such as Arbitrum and Polygon, Solaxy becomes a critical solution for Solana users, who face congestion in their network. 



But is Solaxy the long-term solution to Solana’s problem of scalability, or is it just a patch until the layer one upgrades arrive? 



Have you seen Solana lately? Will it make you think that Layer-2s such as Solaxy will finally make it seamless? 

Let’s discuss!
