Web3 Gaming Platforms Rise—Ready to Challenge Traditional Gaming Giants?

Did you ever notice that gaming is transforming from playing to owning? 



Web3 gaming is becoming viral in 2025 as the market growth increases to $33 billion and is expected to reach $183 billion by 2034.



In normal games, your assets are locked, but in Web3 games, the use of the blockchain is used to give partial ownership of in-game items as NFTs to players and means of earning through play-to-earn models.



Gala Games and Portal Coin are some of the sites at the forefront of decentralized decision-making and player economies, and the innovations of AI and VR bring greater realism to the game. 



North America dominates the industry, but it is being quickly chased away by Asia-Pacific, which has its massive community of gamers. The mobile platform also reigns, bringing Web3 to millions of global citizens.



But here's the catch: as user engagement continues to rise, investment in Web3 gaming reduced by 71% at the beginning of 2025, which is a sign that the industry is still faced with suspicion and regulatory challenges. 



So, do you think that Web3 gaming might actually be on an equal footing with the giants of Sony and Microsoft, or will it remain a niche for cryptocurrency enthusiasts?
