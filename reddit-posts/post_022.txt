**$CATMAN — A Matt Furie Original Now in Presale Phase!**

As many of you are probably aware, **Matt Furie-inspired coins** are surging to new heights daily on the Ethereum blockchain. The most notable one is **ZEUS**, followed the likes of **Gorth, Boochie, Rato, Izzy, O’Malley, Gass** the list goes on...

But none have really taken off yet on Solana, until now. 

**Let me introduce you to CATMAN!**  
  
Catman is one of Matt Furie’s earliest and most underrated feline characters. He first appeared in Boy’s Club, the same comic series that birthed PEPE the Frog. While PEPE went on to become the face of an entire meme revolution, Catman remained more of a hidden gem within Furie’s original universe.

But recently, as meme coin culture continues to evolve and expand, there’s a renewed interest in Furie’s lesser-known characters. 

Let’s break down why I personally believe each blockchain has carved out its own niche. Based on my observations of meme coins and their respective chains:

**Ethereum** seems to be the natural home for dog-themed coins think DOGE, SHIBA, ZEUS, NEIRO, and others. Why is that the case? Honestly, I don’t exactly know. It’s as if Ethereum is the *kennel* for dog coins, while **Solana** is the *catnip tray* for feline-themed ones.

Solana has become home to some of the most memeable cat coins the space has seen, including POPCAT, MINI, HOSICO, and MASK (CatWifMask). It feels like each animal meme has its preferred blockchain, and the formula only really seems to work one way.

The **Matt Furie meta** is booming. But interestingly, we haven’t seen a Furie creation really take off on Solana lately.

Until now...

**CATMAN's presale** hasn’t even been live for a full day and has already raised a staggering amount of Solana. At the time of writing, CATMAN has raised **117 SOL**!!

The **soft cap has been filled** and the **mid cap is filling up quickly**.
