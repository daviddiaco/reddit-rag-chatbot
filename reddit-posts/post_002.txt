$esgl supercar moonshot

Not really a token but a Nasdaq counter $esgl. Feel it’s relevant to spread the word. Just read that De Tomaso is going to start accepting Bitcoin for their future hypercars (P72, P900 etc). This is not some random NFT rug or hype project—this is an actual legacy European hypercar brand now integrating crypto payments into its core business model. Wild.

They’re pricing their cars at €1.6M+ and opening the door for BTC whales to flex in real life. Imagine parking a hypercar you literally bought with Bitcoin. That’s a flex for the history books.

Even crazier? De Tomaso is merging with a SPAC called $ESGL, which will be renamed $OIO after the vote. So yeah, there’s now a publicly traded company about to represent one of the most exclusive car brands on the planet—and they’re already ahead of the curve on Web3/crypto adoption.

This is one of those rare crossover plays: real world luxury assets + crypto + public markets. If this narrative catches on, $OIO could become a legit gateway stock for crypto investors who want exposure to ultra-luxury and BTC utility in the real world.

Long story short: this isn’t just a car company. It’s crypto culture in motion. Bullish.
