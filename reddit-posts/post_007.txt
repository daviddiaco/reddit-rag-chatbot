HHI score - they are missing something.

For those who do not know what HHI score is:

HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) in crypto measures how concentrated a cryptocurrency’s supply or market share is.  
A higher score means more centralization; a lower score means more decentralization. So basically, the lower the better.

You know for example, you often see these list on ct comparing them. 

It's funny because none of them shared Kendu, which has a HHI score of 28.65. Which is as we saw before very good. 

And on top of that very good HHI score, Kendu isn't a shiny new thing that will only last a few days. Kendu is a 1+ year old project with an insane die-hard relentless community who is working hard to make it a success. It's a permissionless a brand where community-as-a-service is its scaling utility. There exists a symbiotic relationship between Kendu holders and builders building under its umbrella, each spread marketing and brand awareness for the other. The holders provide customers and users to the builders, the builders provide permanent and infinitely scalable brand awareness for the holders. The voluntary culture is to give back to the project if you are profiting from it. Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Kendu is the Impossible made possible.  
And You are the secret ingredient.

Chart is primed for a new ath. A major redistribution has happened, all the strong hands and believers are accumulating right now. Platforms like Stocktwits take notice of our hard work and determination to succeed. It's all about the community. There is no second best in this space. Choose the role you want to play in the rise of the leading multi-billion dollar permissionless brand and join the most dedicated, skilled, and connected community in the industry.

We have:

\- KenduGames, an indie Web2 gaming studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs.  
\- Kendu energy, an energy drinks brand with new flavours being explored.  
\- Kendu Coffee, Kendu's own speciality coffee roast.  
\- Kendu Vendu, vending machines with AI, soon to launch and enable the community to invest in Kendu - Vendu machines in their localities.

\- Kendu eSports, hot dogs, vapes, plushies, chocolates, vodka, sweets, jewelry, merch, and so much more...

Don't be surprised when you see Kendu at a multi-billion dollar valuation. Don't be surprised when you see it go into the 10s of billions and higher, either. It will be a household name, and you'll remember reading this message and either listening or not.

Kendu is inevitable.

Wish you all the best, we are all going to make it.
