$GOON – A Basic Meme Coin Done Right

No overcomplicated promises and no buzzwords. No fake narratives about transforming the world through revolutionary blockchain use cases. Just memes. 
$GOON isn’t here to pretend we’re solving problems that never existed. We’re here because memecoins were never supposed to be serious in the first place. They were a reaction, a celebration, a collective inside joke between strangers who understood each other through images and absurdity. What made early memecoins powerful wasn’t tokenomics or partnerships or launchpads. It was that feeling that for once, the internet had a joke only it could understand. 
Somewhere along the way, we started pretending memes needed utility, and that culture had to be pitch-decked and roadmap-ready. But that’s not what got us here. $GOON is for everyone who remembers when it was okay for a coin to exist purely because it was funny. For everyone who still believes that a good meme travels faster than a marketing campaign. For everyone tired of copy-paste hype and empty NFT tie-ins. We’re not innovating. We’re remembering. Join us if you’re still into the good stuff. The weird stuff. The scroll-worthy, tab-opening, no-utility-needed stuff. 

This is $GOON. Old internet energy. No shame attached.
