How big is the DeFi ecosytem?

You can call the first part of this a beginner guide to DeFi and what it's about, as a lot of the things there would sound familiar to anyone that has been in this space for a while. But the general idea is to remind everyone that DeFi is here to stay and it would be here for a long time. 

The obvious reason is because it's reshaping how we interact with money, as it offers open, high-yield financial tools without banks or intermediaries, basically letting anyone  with a wallet and internet access lend, borrow, or trade, bypassing traditional gatekeepers. 

  
But another but not so obvious reason is the opportunity that the DeFi ecosystem provides for us users and traders, think of projects like  AAVE, Uniswap etc and how well they've done over the years, and even how newer projects like Skates have performed, a project that was listed on Bitget not too long ago. 

  
I personally think there's an element of hype to these projects, but you cannot undermine the role that their utility plays in this push, and that's why I ultimately think these kinds of projects and the DeFi ecosystem will always be mainstream.
