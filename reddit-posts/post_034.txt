TassHub is fully open-source, and the dev is doxxed. This is a long-term project for serious creators and early adopters who want to support innovation on Solana.

TassHub is a utility-first platform token built on the Solana blockchain, designed to power a decentralized content economy where creators retain ownership, earn more, and interact directly with their audiences. It is not a meme coin or hype project, but a functional ecosystem with real use cases from the beginning.

On TassHub, creators can mint digital assets, launch gated communities, sell subscriptions, and monetize directly without relying on third-party Web2 intermediaries. The platform supports a modular system of smart contracts that handle revenue sharing, digital licensing, and automated royalty payments. All of this is powered by the TASSHUB token, which is the core utility token used for transactions, staking, and platform access.

Built on Solana, TassHub offers lightning-fast transactions and negligible gas fees, making it ideal for high-volume digital platforms. The TASS token had a fair launch with zero presale, no venture capital involvement, and no team allocation. All tokens are circulating and the liquidity is locked. The contract is verified and audited. CA FKNfAwb8TmjYkj11V4NiTz4TgrLWTWgm2NRwAD9epump

The roadmap includes the launch of the Creator Studio in Q3, featuring AI-powered content tools, peer-to-peer storefronts, and analytics dashboards. In Q4, TassHub will activate its DAO layer to allow token holders to vote on new features, token burns, and treasury allocations.
