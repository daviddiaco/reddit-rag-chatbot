$PYRATE starts a huge marketing push tomorrow, donâ€™t miss it!

**$PYRATE** is gearing up for a major marketing push starting tomorrow. This campaign includes: **rank and volume bots, DEX boosts, DEX ads, Reddit posts and X raids**. The setup looks very bullish and I see a lot of potential here ðŸ“ˆ  

Youâ€™ve probably already come across $PYRATE on Reddit, as theyâ€™ve always been highly here. But in case you havenâ€™t, hereâ€™s a quick overview of what $PYRATE is and what theyâ€™ve achieved so far ðŸ‘‡  

**What is $PYRATE?**  

$PYRATE is a Solana-based project that has developed a powerful Telegram bot with over **140K+ active users**. It has one of the most engaged communities Iâ€™ve ever seen. They are very active on the socials with stunning art, community events and collabs. On top of that they launched their own **$PYRATE NFTs**. The dev (Alex) is **doxxed and highly skilled**. $PYRATE is listed on **CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and working on a CEX listing**, they recently launched a new website and a game bot built by a community memberðŸ’ª

Technical Overview:  
*	Market Cap: 320K  
*	Strong Support: 300K  
* Holders: 2k  
* Top 10 Wallets: 18%  
*	ATH: 3M  

With this new marketing push, Iâ€™m expecting at least a **5x, and potentially even a run back to ATH levels**. Make sure to get in before the marketing push begins, thatâ€™s when youâ€™ll benefit the most! ðŸš€
