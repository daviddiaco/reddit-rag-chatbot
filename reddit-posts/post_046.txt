🌃 **>>>Introduction**  
Alpha City is a collective of like-minded SUI enthusiasts and traders dedicated to a single mission: building value. Created within an ecosystem of propriety, custom AI, Alpha City is designed to benefit holders with a combination of profit-sharing, cutting-edge trading tools, innovative community-building, and immersive storytelling experiences.

🌃 **>>>Why We’re Here**  
Cryptocurrency ecosystems are overrun by two major challenges: shady developers scamming money *out* of the blockchain, and soulless AI clogging the internet with useless “reply guy” drivel. The result — for users — is the recurrent experience of inhuman community, pretend “utility,” and shrinking wallets.

Survive those turbulent waters, and you may still be at the mercy of well-connected whales, whose insider knowledge means they’re always one stroke ahead — sucking up most of the profits before you can get there.

Until now.

🌃 **>>>Our Solution**  
Alpha City is our answer to the above, with transparent developers leveraging proprietary AI to help you swim alongside the whales and sharks — while having a good time along the way. Our primary objectives are as follows:   
a. Rewarding holders  
b. Integration of *profitable* AI-utility via trading alerts, wallet-tracking, analytics, etc.   
c. Public-facing operational visibility.   
d. Meaningful, lasting community development.

🌃 **>>>Holder Benefits**  
We realize that the key to a thriving community is this: build value. Want bullish holders? Build value. Marketing collaborations? Build value. Good reputation? You guessed it: build value.

So that’s our plan.

$CITY holder benefits include the following:  
1. **LP fee distribution.** Our project-funded liquidity pool, worth tens of thousands in value, will create long-term revenue via LP fees — potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars per week. These fees will be divided as follows:   
a. *Minimum* 40% distributed to Sovereign-tier holders (described below).   
b. *Minimum* 10% distributed via raffle to our most-active Telegram members.   
c. *Up to* 50% utilized for project initiatives (e.g., tech upgrades) and token buybacks/burns.

2. Cutting-edge, evolving trading alpha, delivered by our network of AI agents. Our toolset grows almost daily, but has *already* made thousands of $ for users and currently includes:   
a. Real-time alerts for trading volatility (e.g., if a coin price increases or decreases rapidly due to whale buys/sells).   
b. Real-time alerts for whale-wallet transactions.   
c. Real-time alerts for newly-released and trending .   
d. Real-time analysis for hundreds of SUI network coins.

3. Token-burning initiatives (NFT mint, merchandise sales, etc.)

4. Alpha-sharing, via our community of dedicated traders and SUI-native influencers.

5. Tech monetization and profit distribution (e.g., future rental of Telegram or X bots to other projects).

6. Scaling tokenomic pressure from token burns and from our advanced ranking system (outlined below).

🌃 **>>>Ranking and Social Systems**  
Our community includes two concurrent ranking systems, both of them tracked and managed by custom AI.

System 1: Holdings-based — designed to create tokenomic pressure via scaling whale incentives.

These scores will help to determine eligibility for rewards, potential rank upgrades, ecosystem access, etc. Alpha City aspires to be a place where you can create wealth with new friends. So we’re building it to cover all the bases.
