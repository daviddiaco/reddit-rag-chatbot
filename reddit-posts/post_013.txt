Veltocoin $VELT: Stanford founders, New Consensus Mechanism, L2 Launchpad, Integrated Social Media Platform

***What is Veltocoin about?***

Very early-stage non-profit project promising a new class of deflationary Web3 assets. They introduce the term cryptosecurities, which emulate the stable, equity-like growth of traditional financial instruments, such as S&P 500 index funds. 

Veltocoin is designed to offer investors more predictable returns and aligning closer with traditional securities rather than the unpredictable nature of most cryptocurrencies.

***New consensus mechanism***

In doing so, the developers have made a new consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Virality. PoV is designed to reward social capital and reward those who grow the Veltocoin network. PoV is designed to support the deflationary equity-like nature of Veltocoin.

***L2 launchpad***

Veltocoin will have its own L2 launchpad where other tokens can build off the same consensus mechanism, essentially building an entire cryptosecurity market much like the modern stock market.

***Integrated social media platform***

Veltocoin will have its own social media platform where users can be rewarded with VELT. This is designed to boost the virality of Veltocoin and other tokens built on its launchpad.

***Conclusion***

Audits are said to be in progress. Testnet development is live and tokens will be airdropped upon the official ICO.

This came up on my Twitter feed and I thought the whitepaper was pretty convincing. The contract code seems clean as well. 

Clearly, do not take this as financial advice and do your own research.
